Plugin Builder Results
Congratulations! You just built a plugin for QGIS!


Your plugin Arc3D was created in:
  /Users/shai/Documents/Projects/qgis_3d_arcs/plugin/arc_3d 
Your QGIS plugin directory is located at:
  /Users/shai/Library/Application Support/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/python/plugins 
What's Next
Test the generated sources using make test (or run tests from your IDE) 
Copy the entire directory containing your new plugin to the QGIS plugin directory (see Notes below) 
Test the plugin by enabling it in the QGIS plugin manager and enabling the provider in the Processing Options 
Customize it by editing the implementation file arc_3d_algorithm.py 
Notes: 
You can use the Makefile to compile and deploy when you make changes. This requires GNU make (gmake). The Makefile is ready to use, however you will have to edit it to add addional Python source files, dialogs, and translations. 
You can also use pb_tool to compile and deploy your plugin. Tweak the pb_tool.cfg file included with your plugin as you add files. Install pb_tool using pip or easy_install. See http://loc8.cc/pb_tool for more information.

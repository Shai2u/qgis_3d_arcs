description=Tool to convert 2D lines to 3D Arcs
version=0.1
author=Shai Sussman
email=shai.sussman@gmail.com

about=This tool transforms 2D lines into 3D arcs, similar to Deck.gl’s 3D arc layer. The 3D data is embedded directly in the feature’s geometry, allowing users to visualize the arcs in QGIS 3D. Additionally, the 3D arcs can be exported as GeoJSON for use in other platforms that support 3D coordinates.

Plugin Builder Results
Congratulations! You just built a plugin for QGIS!

Your plugin Arc3D was created in:
/Users/shai/Documents/Projects/qgis_3d_arcs/plugin/arcs_3d
Your QGIS plugin directory is located at:
/Users/shai/Library/Application Support/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/python/plugins
What's Next
If resources.py is not present in your plugin directory, compile the resources file using pyrcc5 (simply use pb_tool or make if you have automake)
Optionally, test the generated sources using make test (or run tests from your IDE)
Copy the entire directory containing your new plugin to the QGIS plugin directory (see Notes below)
Test the plugin by enabling it in the QGIS plugin manager
Customize it by editing the implementation file arcs_3d.py
Create your own custom icon, replacing the default icon.png
Modify your user interface by opening arcs_3d_dialog_base.ui in Qt Designer
Notes:
You can use pb_tool to compile, deploy, and manage your plugin. Tweak the pb_tool.cfg file included with your plugin as you add files. Install pb_tool using pip or easy_install. See http://loc8.cc/pb_tool for more information.
You can also use the Makefile to compile and deploy when you make changes. This requires GNU make (gmake). The Makefile is ready to use, however you will have to edit it to add addional Python source files, dialogs, and translations.
For information on writing PyQGIS code, see http://loc8.cc/pyqgis_resources for a list of resources.
